  {
    "Type": "MCQ",
    "Category": "acidbase",
    "Subcategory": null,
    "Question": "Why does alkalosis predispose patients to tetany?",
    "Options": "A. Increased calcium reabsorption by the kidneys | B. Low total serum calcium reduces neuronal inhibition | C. Calcium binds more strongly to albumin, reducing ionised calcium | D. Alkalosis reduces extracellular H\u207a, shifting acid\u2013base balance | E. Hypokalaemia associated with alkalosis increases muscle excitability",
    "Answer": "C. Calcium binds more strongly to albumin, reducing ionised calcium",
    "Explanation": "Alkalosis reduces hydrogen ions in plasma, allowing albumin to bind more calcium. This reduces ionised calcium, increasing neuronal excitability and risk of tetany.",

    "Answer": "In chronic respiratory acidosis, the kidneys compensate by increasing the reabsorption of bicarbonate (HCO\u2083\u207b) and increasing hydrogen ion (H\u207a) excretion. This includes enhanced activity of alpha intercalated cells in the distal tubule and increased glutamine metabolism, which generates new bicarbonate and ammonium ions for acid excretion, helping to restore plasma pH toward normal (7.35\u20137.45).",

    "Options": "",
    "Answer": "In hypokalaemia, potassium shifts from the intracellular to extracellular space. To maintain electrochemical neutrality, H\u207a ions move into cells, reducing extracellular H\u207a and contributing to alkalosis. Additionally, in the kidneys, low plasma K\u207a stimulates H\u207a secretion by intercalated cells, further increasing bicarbonate reabsorption and worsening alkalosis.",

How does the kidney normally contribute to acid-base balance, and what is impaired in this case?",
    "Options": "",
    "Answer": "The kidney maintains acid-base balance by reabsorbing filtered bicarbonate and excreting hydrogen ions (H\u207a), primarily via the proximal tubule and alpha intercalated cells. In chronic kidney disease, these processes are impaired\u2014leading to reduced bicarbonate regeneration and insufficient acid excretion\u2014resulting in metabolic acidosis.",

    "Options": "",
    "Answer": "Hyperventilation leads to excessive loss of CO\u2082, reducing pCO\u2082 in the blood (hypocapnia). This causes respiratory alkalosis (plasma pH >7.45). Alkalosis increases the binding of calcium to albumin, reducing ionised calcium (free Ca\u00b2\u207a; normal: 1.1\u20131.3\u202fmmol/L), which increases neuronal excitability, producing symptoms like paraesthesia and muscle cramps.",

    "Options": "",
    "Answer": "Rhabdomyolysis causes massive breakdown of muscle cells, releasing intracellular potassium (K\u207a) and organic acids into the bloodstream.

    "Options": "",
    "Answer": "The patient likely has a normal anion gap (hyperchloraemic) metabolic acidosis. Diarrhoea causes excessive loss of bicarbonate from the gastrointestinal tract, reducing plasma HCO\u2083\u207b (normal: 22\u201328\u202fmmol/L).

Abnormalities in the development or closure of the urethral folds can result in epispadias or hypospadias, where the urethral opening is mispositioned.",

    "Options": "",
    "Answer": "The pronephros, although non-functional in humans, is developmentally significant because it gives rise to the pronephric duct, which persists and becomes the mesonephric duct. This duct is essential for the formation of the mesonephros, and later contributes to both urinary and reproductive system development. The mesonephric duct also gives rise to the ureteric bud, which induces the formation of the metanephros \u2014 the permanent kidney. Thus, the pronephros initiates a cascade critical to urinary system development.",

    "Answer": "The three excretory systems\u2014pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros\u2014develop sequentially from the intermediate mesoderm. Pronephros appears first in the cervical region around day 20 but is non-functional and degenerates by the end of week 4. Mesonephros forms in the thoracolumbar region and functions transiently as a primitive kidney.

The ureteric bud, derived from the mesonephric duct, branches to form the collecting system (ureter, renal pelvis, calyces, and collecting ducts). It induces the surrounding metanephric mesenchyme (blastema), which in turn differentiates to form the nephron (glomerulus, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, and distal tubule).",

    "Answer": "The ureteric bud (from the mesonephric duct) is interacting with the metanephric blastema (undifferentiated intermediate mesoderm).

    "Options": "A. Proximal tubule \u2013 wide lumen, no brush border | B. Distal tubule \u2013 prominent brush border | C. Proximal tubule \u2013 eosinophilic cytoplasm, brush border | D. Distal tubule \u2013 tall columnar cells, thick basement membrane | E. Distal tubule \u2013 squamous cells, large nuclei",
    "Answer": "C. Proximal tubule \u2013 eosinophilic cytoplasm, brush border",
    "Explanation": "Proximal tubule cells are intensely eosinophilic and contain a brush border of microvilli to enhance reabsorption. In contrast, distal tubule cells have paler cytoplasm, fewer microvilli, and a wider lumen.",
