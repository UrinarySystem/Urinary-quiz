    "Question": "A 24-year-old man presents with a 3-day history of profuse diarrhoea. Arterial blood gas shows: pH 7.28 (7.35\u20137.45), pCO\u2082 4.7\u202fkPa (4.0\u20136.0), HCO\u2083\u207b 17\u202fmmol/L (22\u201328). What is the most likely acid-base disturbance?",
    "Options": "A. Metabolic alkalosis | B. Metabolic acidosis | C. Respiratory acidosis | D. Respiratory alkalosis | E. Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis",
    "Answer": "B. Metabolic acidosis",
    "Explanation": "The low pH and low bicarbonate indicate metabolic acidosis. The pCO\u2082 is within normal range, suggesting limited or no respiratory compensation. Diarrhoea is a classic cause due to bicarbonate loss from the GI tract.",
    "Image": null
  },
  {
    "Type": "MCQ",
    "Category": "acidbase",
    "Subcategory": null,
    "Question": "A 19-year-old woman is brought in following a panic attack. Arterial blood gas shows: pH 7.53 (7.35\u20137.45), pCO\u2082 3.2\u202fkPa (4.0\u20136.0), HCO\u2083\u207b 23\u202fmmol/L (22\u201328). What is the most likely acid-base disturbance?",
    "Options": "A. Metabolic alkalosis | B. Respiratory acidosis | C. Respiratory alkalosis | D. Mixed alkalosis | E. Compensated metabolic acidosis",
    "Answer": "C. Respiratory alkalosis",
    "Explanation": "High pH with low pCO\u2082 and normal bicarbonate indicates acute respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation during the panic attack.",
    "Image": null
  },
  {
    "Type": "MCQ",
    "Category": "acidbase",
    "Subcategory": null,
    "Question": "A 45-year-old man with COPD presents with confusion. ABG shows: pH 7.30 (7.35\u20137.45), pCO\u2082 7.1\u202fkPa (4.0\u20136.0), HCO\u2083\u207b 28\u202fmmol/L (22\u201328). What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "Options": "A. Metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation | B. Respiratory acidosis with renal compensation | C. Acute respiratory alkalosis | D. Mixed acidosis | E. Compensated metabolic alkalosis",

    "Question": "A 30-year-old woman is found unconscious. Glucose: 1.8\u202fmmol/L (3.9\u20135.8). ABG: pH 7.10 (7.35\u20137.45), pCO\u2082 2.9\u202fkPa (4.0\u20136.0), HCO\u2083\u207b 8\u202fmmol/L (22\u201328). Which compensatory mechanism is most likely?",
    "Options": "A. Decreased renal H\u207a excretion | B. Increased renal bicarbonate excretion | C. Hyperventilation | D. Hypoventilation | E. No compensation",
    "Answer": "C. Hyperventilation",
    "Explanation": "A low bicarbonate and low pH confirm metabolic acidosis. The low pCO\u2082 indicates respiratory compensation via hyperventilation.",

    "Question": "A patient has an ABG with: pH 7.55 (7.35\u20137.45), pCO\u2082 6.3\u202fkPa (4.0\u20136.0), HCO\u2083\u207b 34\u202fmmol/L (22\u201328). What is the most likely cause?",
    "Options": "A. Hyperventilation | B. Diabetic ketoacidosis | C. Persistent vomiting | D. Chronic renal failure | E. Acute asthma",
    "Answer": "C. Persistent vomiting",
    "Explanation": "Metabolic alkalosis is suggested by high pH and elevated bicarbonate. The raised pCO\u2082 indicates respiratory compensation. Vomiting causes loss of gastric acid, leading to alkalosis.",

    "Answer": "C. 7.35\u20137.45",
    "Explanation": "Plasma pH is tightly regulated between 7.35 and 7.45. Values outside this range significantly affect protein function and cell membrane excitability.",
    "Image": null

    "Options": "A. Renal tubular acidosis | B. Lactic acidosis | C. Diabetic ketoacidosis | D. Hyperventilation | E. Persistent vomiting",
    "Answer": "C. Diabetic ketoacidosis",
    "Explanation": "A high anion gap (25\u202fmmol/L) and the clinical picture point to diabetic ketoacidosis, characterised by metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.",

  },
  {
    "Type": "MCQ",
    "Category": "acidbase",
    "Subcategory": null,
    "Question": "Why does alkalosis predispose patients to tetany?",
    "Options": "A. Increased calcium reabsorption by the kidneys | B. Low total serum calcium reduces neuronal inhibition | C. Calcium binds more strongly to albumin, reducing ionised calcium | D. Alkalosis reduces extracellular H\u207a, shifting acid\u2013base balance | E. Hypokalaemia associated with alkalosis increases muscle excitability",
    "Answer": "C. Calcium binds more strongly to albumin, reducing ionised calcium",
    "Explanation": "Alkalosis reduces hydrogen ions in plasma, allowing albumin to bind more calcium. This reduces ionised calcium, increasing neuronal excitability and risk of tetany.",

    "Question": "A 35-year-old man is admitted with muscle pain and dark urine following a seizure. Lab results: K\u207a 6.8\u202fmmol/L (3.5\u20135.0), HCO\u2083\u207b 14\u202fmmol/L (22\u201328), pH 7.21 (7.35\u20137.45). What is the most likely acid-base disturbance?",
    "Options": "A. Respiratory alkalosis | B. Metabolic alkalosis with hypokalaemia | C. Metabolic acidosis with hyperkalaemia | D. Respiratory acidosis | E. Metabolic alkalosis with hypercalcaemia",
    "Answer": "C. Metabolic acidosis with hyperkalaemia",
    "Explanation": "Rhabdomyolysis leads to cellular breakdown, releasing H\u207a and K\u207a into plasma, causing metabolic acidosis and hyperkalaemia. The dark urine suggests myoglobinuria.",

    "Answer": "C. Proximal tubule",
    "Explanation": "Around 80\u201390% of filtered bicarbonate is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule via carbonic anhydrase\u2013mediated conversion and secondary active transport with sodium.",
